  <h2>Michelle Claire</h2>
   <p>My name is Michelle Claire,I am seventeen years i cleared highschool in the year 2017.<p/>
   <p>I was born and grew up in Nairobi, i have four siblings who are older then me, hence im the last born.I was born on July 17th the year 2000.Listening to music is what i enjoy doing most,especially when im alone in my room. When im out with friends, i love playing video games and eating.My favourite dish is rice, meat and avocado, especially when taken with youghurt or soda, most preferabbly fanta Passion. Moreover I enjoy the cold weather, but only when I'm indoors,due to the mud and a lot of water puddles.<p/>
